Notes:
* Code was converted from C++ using ChatGPT and was quite painless
* I can't figure out how to automatically cast inputs "x" and "y" into f32
* Code is not multi-threaded yet
* There is some attempt to use SIMD via the "cpu=native" flag
* I still have to do some performance testing against C++ code
